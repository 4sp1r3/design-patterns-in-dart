# Fascade Pattern
The facade pattern (also spelled fa√ßade) is a software-design pattern commonly used in object-oriented programming. Analogous to a facade in architecture, a facade is an object that serves as a front-facing interface masking more complex underlying or structural code.

The facade pattern is typically used when:
* a simple interface is required to access a complex system,
* a system is very complex or difficult to understand,
* an entry point is needed to each level of layered software, or
* the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.
