# Design Patterns in Dart

Welcome! The intent of this repo is to provide

1. Examples for each for each of the [23 Gang of Four design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
2. An introduction to the [Dart programming language](https://dart.dev/)

Please see [Getting Started](#getting-started) for more information on how to run the examples.

## Getting Started

Each example has its own directory, inside which is a short readme and a sole Dart file.
To run the example, make sure you [have Dart installed](https://dart.dev/get-dart) and then just do
```
dart <example directory>/<example name>.dart
```
Take [State](https://github.com/scottt2/design-patterns-in-dart/tree/master/state), for example:
```
> dart state/state.dart

The light switch is off.
Toggling the light switch...
  Touching the Stateful...
  Handler of StatusOff is being called!
The light switch is on.
```

If you have any questions or see any issues, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/scottt2/design-patterns-in-dart/issues/new).

Enjoy!
